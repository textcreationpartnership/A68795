            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But a ſtrong ſtreame of importunities hath borne me downe. My love to my friends hath ſubdued me to them. They
<pb facs="tcp:28191:3"/>beſieged me ſo ſtrongly, that they have entred and taken away the keyes of the City, and pillaged me of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and this little thing, which they cal good booty; but they are miſtaken: But now they have it, much good may it doe them; I ſtood out againſt them, not becauſe I prized it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought it not good enough for them. It ſhall much pleaſe mee, if they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a prey of it, find it worth their having. Since it doth fall into their hands,
<pb facs="tcp:28191:3"/>the good bleſsing of GOD goe with it, that it may bee better to them than the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt ſpoyles. <hi>Madam,</hi> in this buſineſſe, the next thing that I deſired was to reſerve the firſt for you; and to ſtamp upon every one, ſome ſmall impreſſe of my obliged reſpects unto you: Ladyſhip.

It is true nobleneſſe to bee of a large and diffuſive ſpirit. He that is all for himſelfe, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his thankes from himſelfe; but to doe good to others, begets a ſtrong reflexion of true honour.

            <p>The Heathen blundered in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gueſſes how to redreſſe the ſtate of man: they ſaw an unhappineſſe, but neither knew the cauſe, nor cure; yet ſomething they aſſayed, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thoſe two rules to repaire the breach:
<pb facs="tcp:28191:7"/>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> To reduce things to the firſt principles of nature.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> To live according unto nature.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe rules are uſefull, if rectified and rightly uſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, reduce things to their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive originalls, and lay them againe in the wombe whence they ſprang: This experiment would profit much. Looke into the world, and you ſhall ſee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed mixture of good and evill, but you muſt divide them wiſely, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them to their beginnings. Aſcend by the ſcattered beames of happineſſe in the world, to the Sunne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from whence they flow; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend by the black and bitter ſtreams of miſery, to the poyſoned ſpring that ſends them forth, and you will ſee two origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls of both; God the fountaine of life,
<pb facs="tcp:28191:7"/>and ſinne the root of death. In this way of reduction of things to their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, a man may ſee as in a glaſſe, what he was, and what he ſhould be, what made him miſerable, and what would make him happy. It is mens unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of two guides to chooſe the worſe, brutiſhly declining reaſon to be led by ſenſe; ſeeing, enjoying, and ſuffering things, without inquiſition into their parentage. This is true folly to dwell in the ſurface of things, not penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into their inmoſt nature, utmoſt end, formoſt riſe. A wiſe man ſeeth things quite through from firſt to laſt; he asketh three queſtions of the things be meets with; What are you? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe you? Whence come you? He lives not like a ſubject to the world, but as a Lord; he examineth and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, he ſuffereth no vagrants,
<pb facs="tcp:28191:8"/>but keepes all in order, hath the genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of all things, and reduceth them to their ſeverall Tribes. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine voice in things inviting home, and proclaiming the cauſes to which they owe their being; they carry a tye in which they are linked to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and by this line men might have conduct through the labyrinth of the Vniverſe, to the firſt cauſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another rule is given, <hi>Live according to nature.</hi> This ſounds harſh,<note place="margin">Qui mali ſunt, cos malos eſſe non ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuo, ſed eoſdem eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, purè at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go; nam uti cadaver hominem mortuum dixeris, ſimplicitèr verò hominem appellare non poſſis &amp;c. <hi>

There is in all men an implanted inclination to happineſſe, and an home borne Pilot
<pb facs="tcp:28191:8"/>to carry this in a right courſe; but it is true, though the former be not hurt, yet the latter is; a man is another thing then he was, the ſoule is quick of foot, but dull of ſcent; her ſayles are ſtrong, but her compaſſe is marred. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall judgement, the ſoules ſteares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is dim ſighted, and takes rocks for harbours, ſea for land, weſt for eaſt, earth for heaven. But herein is mans great unhappineſſe; God hath opened a way to renew thoſe blurred characters of knowledge, which yet remaine as the light in the ayre after ſunne ſet, but man regardeth not. The Scriptures are given by inſpiration of God to make wiſe unto ſalvation, but men are ſo farre from due ſeeking to lighten that glimmering ſnuffe of naturall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at this fountaine of light, that they are in love with their owne dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:28191:9"/>
               <hi>they hate the light, becauſe their deeds are evill.</hi> Finding the power of conſcience a check to their luſts, they reſiſt it; whereas they ſhould rectifie conſcience by the word, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by conſcience, they perverſely caſt off conſcience to give way to ſinne; yea of a grave counſeller, they turne it into a baſe flatterer, to applaud their greateſt folly and wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>But what will the end be? Shall God come againe with tenders of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a new league of friendſhip, and ſhall man hang off? Let thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſider this, to whom God hath come with many gracious viſits and potent workings, yet they come not in. I did purpoſe and promiſe in the beginning of this Treatiſe, to ſpeake of Gods leaving ſuch, but I wanted opportunity at preſent.
<pb facs="tcp:28191:9"/>I ſay no more now to them, but this, It is dangerous to deſpiſe grace, and to reſiſt the Spirit; if he depart, woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: your latter end will pay you for your folly and ſtoutneſſe.</p>
            <p>The day is comming, in which God will follow after fooliſh man no more; wonder at his patience that hath waited on the world ſome thouſands of yeares already; but this long laſting patience hath fixed its period; then bleſſed are they that enjoy him: as for all the reſt, adieu for ever: then God will depart fully and eternally; it ſhall no more be ſaid, <hi>Come,</hi> but then <hi>Goe</hi> ye accurſed into everlaſting fire.</p>
            <p>You have now your choice, here is God and the world; But this is folly, men take that in a disjunctive ſenſe, which is offered in a conjunctive: It is not ſaid, God <hi>or</hi> the world, but God <hi>and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:28191:10"/>the world. In ſome conſideration indeed they are divided, but moſt make the worſt choice: Here begins that vaſt diſtance betwixt the Saints and the wicked; they ſet out at firſt from one point, but more diverſe, yea adverſe wayes, according to the difference of their ends: a godly man when firſt he chooſeth God, becomes an happie man, for his choice is his guide, which ſets all the wheeles in a right motion: love is as the wing to the fowle, or as the oares to the boate, which move it and order it<note n="(a)" place="margin">Nec fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bonos vel malos mores, niſi boni vel mali amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res <hi>Aug. ep.</hi> 53. <hi>p.</hi> 236.</note>.</p>
            <p>When this is done, God and man brought together, this ſweet meeting and amiable conjunction is a great part of the plot of that eternall love of God, who choſe us that wee might be enhappied by anſwering his choice of us, with our choice of him; <hi>that
<pb facs="tcp:28191:10"/>hee may dwell in us, and wee in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinkes this world is like the Kings Court:<note place="margin">Si terram amas, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra es: Si Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amas, quid vis ut dica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Deus es. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> children here are taken with pictures, and feed their eyes and fancies with hangings and fine things; but the wife and grave Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men paſſe by theſe, their buſineſſe is with the King: moſt men ſtay in the out roomes, and low things of the world, and ſo are meane; but bleſſed is the generation, whoſe eye, deſire, and way are unto God.</p>
            <p>The creature is not capable of an higher bleſſedneſſe, then to have God for his God. They that dwell in God have a true dwelling; men who live upon the creature, doe not dwell, but roll as Ships at ſea, or travell as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vagrants: in God there is quiet abode, and perfect reſt; for here is no
<pb facs="tcp:28191:11"/>evill, nor want of God; here is enough, and ſuch as may fit all times, all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all occaſions, ſoule and body fully. Here in theſe deepes are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the minde to feed on: here alſo is ſea-roome of goodneſſe for the vaſt appetite of man to floate in<note n="(a)" place="margin">Tu Deus te diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti oſtendis te, &amp; ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis ei. <hi>Id. conf.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</note>, and the ſatiety of the appetite breeds all repoſe and joy. Oh the delectable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this condition! In this is a depth of riches, deepe riches that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſounded, and rich deepes that cannot be exhauſted: the Man <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the bleſſed channell betwixt the Fountaine and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne, through which grace, life, peace, ſtrength, glory come by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and a glorious convoy; every veſſell ſhall have its fulneſſe to all eternity; ſometimes indeed (while this life laſteth) the ſtreames come
<pb facs="tcp:28191:11"/>fuller, and ſometimes ſlower: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Chriſt ſtayeth the current that we may thirſt, that after thirſting we may drinke againe with redoubled pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This is the maine of a godly mans unhappineſſe, that he neither hath a full, nor a fixed ſtate of comfortable communion with God in the world: after ſweet meetings come ſad part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Nothing is fixed, there is a flood and ebbe as well on land as in the ſea, and as well in things ſpirituall, as in things naturall: even thoſe that are ſtronglieſt knit, have a time of parting. Nothing in nature is more conjunct then its owne frame, yet this compacted compoſition admits a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: Man, the epitome of the world, is in this caſe; ſoule and body one day will ſhake hands, yea and the
<pb facs="tcp:28191:12"/>body will fall aſunder from it ſelfe, thoſe foure elements that came in, in a vitall league, will goe out againe with a deadly warre. The tye betwixt God and the ſoule is the firmeſt thing in the world, the bond of grace is ſtronger than the bond of nature, yet even here is a kinde of parting alſo; but as the conjunction is ſtronger, ſo the ſeparation is leſſe: but ſometimes it is ſo great, that the Saints by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of ſorrow cry out, <hi>My God hath forſaken me, my Lord hath forgotten me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſad condition is the ſubject of this little Treatiſe, concerning which I would have put here ſome adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements; but my pen hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mee, and hath led me out into a larger and another way then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Preface. Nothing
<pb facs="tcp:28191:12"/>more is now to be done, but to leave this ſmall helpe in the hands of ſuch, whoſe ſoules long after the returne of God, with quickning and comforting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences upon them.</p>

                  <hi>We are confident of this very thing, that hee that hath begun the good worke in you, will finiſh it untill the day of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. The Saints ſhall have of him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſo neceſſary, as without it they cannot <hi>hold their ſtate, or attain their end:</hi> but that which is rather for their <hi>orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than <hi>ſupportment,</hi> for the <hi>ſweetneſſe

               <p>This then is the thing: when God leaves his people, he doth not ſo leave them to the will of the fleſh; the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſnares of the world, the power and tyrannie of the Price of darkneſſe, as never, or not at all to looke after them; but his care is over them in theſe times, and hee is with them by a <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>powerfull manutenency,</hi> both <hi>guiding</hi> and <hi>upholding</hi> them, and is often moſt in <hi>power,</hi> when leaſt in <hi>appearance.</hi> The metals that lye deep under ground, and ſee not the heavens in their <hi>light,</hi> yet partake of their <hi>influence,</hi> yea ordinarily the moſt precious operations of Gods gracious power are there where is leaſt ſenſe and feeling of them, and they <hi>have</hi> moſt of God when they <hi>ſee</hi> him leaſt. As when God covered <hi>Moſes</hi> his face in the cleft of the rock, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.22. then hee paſſed by, and gave <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſee his glory: ſo the clouds and veiles that cover our eyes, are often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:28191:33"/>of the cleereſt light, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſight of God.</p>
               <p>And when God ſeemes to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man into a deſolate and ruinous heap, yet even then is he building, and preparing him to be a more excellent ſtructure. The gardiner digs up his garden, pulls up his fences, takes up his plants, and to the eye ſeemes to make a pleaſant place, as a waſte; but wee know he is about to <hi>mend</hi> it, not to <hi>mar,</hi> to <hi>plant</hi> it better, and not to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it: So God is preſent even in deſertions, and though he ſeeme to <hi>annihilate,</hi> or to reduce his new creation into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Chaos, yet it is to repaire its ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and to make it more beautifull and more ſtrong. <hi>The glory of the ſecond temple was greater than the glory of the firſt, Hag.</hi> 2.9. In the repairing of an houſe, we ſee how they pull down part after part, as if they intended to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, but the end is to make it better: it may be ſome poſts and pillars are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but it is to put in ſtronger: it may be ſome lights are ſtopped up, but it is to make fairer lights: So though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:28191:34"/>God take away our props, it is not that we may fall, but that he may ſettle us in greater ſtrength; hee batters downe the life of ſenſe, to put us upon a life of faith; and when he darkens our light that we cannot ſee, it is but to bring in fuller light; as when the ſtarres ſhine not, the Sunne appeares, repairing our loſſe of an obſcure light, with her clear bright ſhining beams. So then we ſee, that though God doe forſake his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet <hi>not totally, not for ever,</hi> not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>affection</hi> of love, <hi>but the acts,</hi> and not thoſe which concerne our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but ſuch as concerne our <hi>well being:</hi> As abundant quicknings, and aid of grace, victorious and triumphant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over ſinne, the cleare and ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony of his Spirit, &amp;c.</p>

Now the ſpirit comes with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the tottering and ſtraying ſpirit of his people, and holds their eye, and ſtayeth their thoughts upon their objects, that the ſoule may drinke down knowledge more fully; <hi>tranſient</hi> views let in but <hi>little light.</hi>

               <p>Thus you ſee what this influence of the ſpirit is upon the minde of the

But when the heart is infected with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious luſts, they corrupt the minde, ſeducing, deceiving, and diverting alſo from all ſerious ſtudy of, and enquiry into things ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>In like manner, when God doth not preſent himſelfe, and things ſpirituall, how can it be, but a man ſhould be in much darkneſſe? nothing can reveale God but himſelfe; as the Sunne is not ſeene but by her owne light; and when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:28191:58"/>God hideth himſelfe, all things are hid; he ſeeth leſſe in ſinne, in grace, in Chriſt, in the Goſpel, in all things, that ſeeth leſſe of God; as when the Sun is clouded, all things are proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clouded and obſcured.</p>
               <p>Againe, if God actuate not, and ſtir not up the minde to enquire after him; and to behold him, it will be but as the eye of the body in the time of ſleepe, which ſeeth nothing till it be awakened.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, except God faſten and fix the minde upon himſelfe, and other ſpirituall objects, it will be wandering, and he that goeth from the Sunne, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into darkneſſe.

               <p>An incompleat will is that which is not fully and maturely ſet upon its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and it hath theſe two things in it, or one of them: 1. it is not deliberate, but ſudden, raſh, precipitant; when a thing is not done out of judgment and reaſon, it is not fully voluntary; thus that which is done out of paſſion, as feare, anger, &amp;c. is not a compleat act of the will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not deliberate. 2. It is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, ſo not ſo much a wil as a velliety, which is not a full tendency of the heart to a thing, but a weak, mixed, checked, fluctuating inclinedneſſe to it, the will not going fully one way, but as it hath ſomething to perſwade, and ſomething to diſſwade, ſo it is divided, partly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and partly nilling.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſay:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the greater ſinfulneſſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny act is from the will; for 1 ſome acts which are materially evill, are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally evill without the will; as if a man working with an axe kill a man, though killing be materially evill, yet if the will had no influence into the fact, it is not murther, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.5, 6. ſo happily <hi>Lots</hi>

               <p>NOw I come to deale with ſuch as are forced to draw this ſad conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt themſelves, that God hath <hi>departed</hi> from them: and I feare when men ſeriouſly conſider what hath beene ſaid, that it will be found that not a few have cauſe to ſit downe in the duſt and to poure out teares in the ſad ſenſe of their grievous loſſe of the quickning preſence of God; Me thinkes it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſome that they are changed, and have declined from that luſtre, life and activity of ſpirit, which ſeemed once to be aloft, and to be elevated to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent height of holineſſe, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſſe, but now lyeth grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the duſt, with clouds and chaines of evident darkneſſe and death upon them. And now I wiſh for ſuch a ſpirit, that I might come to them with like ſucceſſe, as the Angel to S. <hi>Peter</hi> when he lay ſleeping in the priſon. <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:28191:176"/>of the Lord came upon him, and a light ſhined in the priſon, and he ſmote Peter on the ſide and raiſed him up, ſaying, ariſe up quickly, and his chaines fell off from his hands, and he went out and followed the Angel.</hi> Acts 12.7.9. God hath ſent us alſo to ſtrike off mens chaines, and to open the iron gate that leades in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpirituall City, and hath given us the hammer, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.29. and with it the key of the Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.52. And oh that he would mannage theſe by his ſtrength, that men might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered that are in priſon.</p>
               <p>In dealing with ſuch, I will take this courſe to draw them out of theſe deepes.</p>
               <p>I will lay down the <hi>matter of perſwaſion, arguments to prevaile, rules to direct.</hi>

Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy undoeth men, you will never ſit down by the waters of Babylon and weep, till you remember Zion from whence you are carried; there could not be place for ſo much ſloth and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in you, if you did ſee and conſider how you are. According to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance which men have with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo are their feares, cares, joyes, endeavours. No man will ſeeke for what he thinkes he hath. <hi>Laodicea</hi> drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med golden dreames, when ſhe ſlept in poverty and ſought not reliefe, becauſe ſhe knew not her need, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.17. it is not a ſleight view, or weak conjecture, or tranſient thought, or light ſuſpition which will rouze the heart out of her ſleep; theſe things may diſquiet, but they are as weak phyſick, which moves the humours, but removes them not, working paine, but not cure; If you ſaw your ſelves indeed wrapped in
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:28191:177"/>darkneſſe and death, lying like <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the grave, covered with earth, bound up and putrified, you would then heare when we cry to you, <hi>Lazarus ariſe.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity would quicken you, nothing could hold you, you would mourn and howle, and pray, and ſeeke, and not ceaſe till you finde, therefore put the caſe out of doubt, and be ſerious and impartiall, it is wiſdome to know well what it is not ſafe to beare, and to know we have not that which is miſery to want.</p>

By which hee <hi>judgeth</hi> all; God being the Supreme Lord, holds this royalty, that all men and Angels are accountable to him in all things: now to apprehend that the Judge of all the world will not ſhew mercy, but will proceed in ſtrictneſſe of juſtice, eſpecially when a man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he is guilty many waies, and that God is privie to all his ſins, muſt needs bee a ſore ſhaking to the ſoule. Though all friends, and miniſters, yea
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:28191:277"/>though all Angels come in to comfort, yet it will not ſatisfie, becauſe they are but ſubjects; God is ſupreme, and his word ſhall ſtand; As if you tell a poore trembling priſoner going to the barre for his life, hee need not feare, he ſhall ſure eſcape, hee will bee apt to anſwer you; alas, except the Judge ſay ſo, all that you ſay, will not profit me; So will a poore afflicted ſoule thinke, when others come and tell him, ſurely your caſe is good, and doubtleſſe you will finde mercy, and heaven will bee your portion; Oh that God would ſay this to mee; except this bee my ſentence at his barre, your comforts are but as ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding braſs, or as a tinckling cymbal.</p>

And as God reſerved much till the Gentiles were called, that when his gueſts were more fully met, he might ſet out more
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:28191:279"/>abundance of his proviſion; ſo God will keepe the rich ſtore of conſiſtent and abiding comforts till the great day, that when all the family ſhall come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he may poure out the fulneſſe of his hidden treaſures upon them. We are now but in the way, and it is fit the beſt ſhould come laſt; we are but yet in the morning of the day, the feaſt is to come; in the meane time a running ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, a break-faſt, a taſte ſhall ſuffice to ſtay the ſtomach, till the time come that the King of Saints with all his friends, ſhall ſit downe together at the Royall Feaſt.</p>
               <p>If you ſend your ſonne to travel, you give him leſſe than his inheritance, and you will ſend them forth by Sea and Land for your ends; ſo God hath ſent you abroad, you are but travellers, therefore muſt not thinke it ſtrange if you meet with ſtormes, and weary daies, and if you have not ſo conſtant a preſence of God with you. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this life and the next, is not ſo much in the kindes of comfort, as in the degrees and continuance of them; this
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:28191:280"/>life hath ſuch a <hi>preſence</hi> of God, as is with a kinde of <hi>abſence.</hi> We know this, <hi>That while we are preſent in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6.</p>
               <p>This life is but our <hi>ſeed time</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. and the ſeed will have a time to be out of our hands, uſe, and ſight, till the harveſt come.</p>
               <p>Now is working time, and the time of fight, and ſervants and ſouldiers muſt not expect any ſetled reſt, till their ſervice is done, and the warres ceaſe. <hi>There remaines a reſt for the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9.</p>
               <p>All the Saints that have gone before us have found ill dayes and hard times, yea <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelfe till his <hi>houre</hi> came that he ſhould be glorified, had trouble in the world, yea he dranke of this cup, which wee have in hand. This makes heaven ſweeter, and puts the ſoule upon more longings for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there it knoweth it ſhall not feare, nor ſorrow any more.</p>
               <p>Conſtant joyes in ſuch a condition as this is in the world, ſute not more than conſtant feaſtings in times of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:28191:280"/>we are freed from the power of ſinne but in part, ſo we are but in part freed from afflictions. And it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except grace were more abundant, that conſtant peace would have ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents. <hi>Paul</hi> was tempted after his exaltation that he might not be exalted. Comfort belongeth not to ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but glorification, therefore the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it is kept till wee bee ſet in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Comfort is the reward of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, therefore the perfection and ſtability of it is kept till that time when holineſſe ſhall be perfected; and the perfection both of grace and peace is deferred, that when Chriſt ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in glory, this may ſet out the day. When Chriſt came in the fleſh, God powred out much of his Spirit at his aſcenſion, and will powre it gloriouſly when all ſhall be conſummate; then Chriſt ſhall ſhine among all his Saints, and the fulneſſe of their perfections, as the Sunne attended with all the ſtarres in their brighteſt glory.</p>
               <p>Till that time, while you are children under tuition, and at ſchoole, you will
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:28191:281"/>meet with frownes as well as ſmiles, and correction daies as well as play daies; and it is well the day is comming that hath no night, and joy that hath no ſorrow with it.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Cauſe. </seg>2</label> Second Cauſe, <hi>in Iudgement to the world:</hi> God might ſend out his Saints as ſtarres in glory, that all eyes might gaze on them, but he will not; all things are in a myſtery and hidden to the world, the graces of the Saints hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many infirmities, and the comforts of the Saints under many ſorrowes, in juſt judgement upon the world. God is wiſe and knoweth how to fit the ſame things for many ends. Chriſt came in a poore eſtate, and his glory and majeſty was covered with a cloud and mantle of a meane outſide; and why was this? It is true, it was for ſatisfaction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for the ſinne of his people; but it was alſo in Judgement to the world; he was a precious one, yet becauſe hee came not in State and pompe, he was a ſtone <hi>refuſed of the builders,</hi> and ſo a <hi>ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rocke of offence,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7, 8. And becauſe the Goſpel
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:28191:281"/>came not with humane dreſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ornament; <hi>The preaching of the croſſe, is to them that periſh fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.18.</p>
               <p>God hath not ſtooped in the matters of heaven to ſenſe, as he hath in the matters of the world; he will not ſend unto men any from the dead, nor yet ſhall any walke among men with ſhining robes of heavenly glory. The things of this life, are ſeene, and taſted; but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things are conveyed moſt in a ſpirituall way. If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his integrity, God would have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelfe to the world as a man to his friend, and not onely faith and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the ſenſes ſhould have beene bleſſed in communion with God; but now he ſo diſpoſeth of all things, that even his people <hi>walke by faith, and not by ſight:</hi> he will not give ſuch a ſenſible demonſtration of his bounty to the world, that it may juſtly periſh in its wickedneſſe, if it will not beleeve <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, and if they will not beleeve the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The world is led by ſenſe; though
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:28191:282"/>the Scriptures teſtifie of the excellency of redemption, and adoption, and of the great happineſſe of the Saints, yet they fooliſhly caſt away faith and the word, and run to ſenſe; and finding the heires of glory to be often ſad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding not their comforts, but their ſorrowes, they conclude that the way is worthleſſe, and that religion is but a ſower grape, and as bitter waters, and as the way of the deſart.</p>

               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:28191:283"/>
               <p n="2">2 God gives much proofe and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of grace which he hath wrought in them, when he makes them ſee they had hearts that could love him, even when it was doubtfull to them whether he loved them; when the truth of grace is evidenced clearely, it brings much comfort, and what greater evidence of an upright heart, then to follow God when he ſeemes to flye away; and to love him when hee ſeemes to abhorre and hate them, to weep upon him in love when he ſeemes armed with weapons of death<note n="y" place="margin">Qui nec iratum ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat colere numen. <hi>Sen</hi> Diis fruitur iratis, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcit malis.</note>; and to powre out the ſoule to him, when hee ſeemes to be powring downe fire and brimſtone upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It gives hope that if darke clouds do ariſe, yet they ſhall be ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; the ſenſe of former troubles may helpe to conclude that ſuch deeps are paſſable; and the ſoule will be apt to ſay there is hope concerning this<note n="z" place="margin">O paſſi graviora: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us dabit his quoque fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem. <hi>Virg.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>It workes more cloſing with Chriſt:</hi> the death of comfort occaſions a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life and ſtrength towards Chriſt, both in deſire of him, and dependance upon him; and for this cauſe God ſhakes the ſoule with earthquakes, that it may ſtand faſter upon its true baſis and foundation; that which at firſt brings the ſoule to Chriſt, is his worth, and our need: and the more wee ſee our ſelves neceſſitous, the more our hearts gather in to Chriſt; the ſoule muſt have ſome reſt, and if it finde none within nor without, it is carried to Chriſt, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove to the Arke; That which is the firſt coard to draw to him, hath alſo a ſtrength to bind to him; therefore God gives his people ſad viſions of ſin, and wrath, that by being ſhaken, they may roote themſelves more in Chriſt; this was Gods great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the more they goe forth to Chriſt, and ſeeke the Father in the Son, the more they are bleſſed; Chriſt is the rock of the Saints, and when they are knit to it, they ſtand faſt; the nearer they are to Chriſt, the nearer are they to all happineſſe; God will not looke friendly upon the ſoule but through <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he will not poure out the ſpirit of comfort but through him; and as comfort comes by comming, ſo the oftner the ſoule comes, and the more it converſeth with Chriſt, and reſteth on him, the more comfort it will finde at laſt: Chriſt will tell you many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and open his fathers boſome to you, when you ſtick cloſe to him.</p>
               <p>And this advantage comes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, that the ſoule is ſo frighted with thoſe ſtormes which it met with, that it is afraid to bee any more out of

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:28191:287"/>God comes in a way of anger, to whip up the ſlothfull and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirit; Duties of godlineſſe are not onely a debt to God, but a reward to us, therefore in ſlightneſſe, there is not onely unfaithfulneſſe, but unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo; both the Majeſty and the Mercy of God is deſpiſed; and can God be well pleaſed with ſuch things?

Thou ſhalt goe forth with thine hands upon thine head, for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou ſhalt not proſper in them,</hi> Jer. 2.32, 37. While the Sun ſhines, and the Sea is calme, you may ſport your ſelves in the deepe, but when the ſtorme comes, then the harbour will be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

               <p>Clay is eaſily molded, but the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble muſt have many blowes; the Sun beames will melt the ſoft, but braſſe muſt be put into the fire. A tender ſprig is eaſily nipped, but a ſtiffe Oake muſt be hacked and hewed before it falls. A ſtout ſpirit brings much ſorrow upon it; It is a grievous temper, if it be not bowed to God, it groweth worſe and

God will overcome: if faire meanes doe not the worke, then he awakes himſelfe as a Lyon, and comes as a man of warre, and lets flye his arrowes into the ſoule, <hi>Iob</hi> 6.4. God tryed <hi>Ephraim</hi> divers waies, but his heart yeelded not; at laſt when warning pieces did not bring him, God mounts his Canons againſt him, and gives him a broad ſide; <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe I was wroth,</hi> Iſay 57.16.17. and then hee ſtrikes ſayle and yeelds, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.19.</p>

               <p>Afflictions come not empty handed, but like a darke cloud bring much after them; there are many things which a man cannot learne in bookes, but hee muſt learne it in himſelfe; a Scholler may read and acquaint himſelfe with the Art of navigation, but that will not make him a good Marriner; nor will the ſtudie of warre make a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but experience makes both.</p>
               <p>God doth all, as in great freedome, ſo in great wiſedome, and having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to ſeverall ends, he leads them in ſeverall ends, and workes them in

As it was in the former kinde of deſertion, ſo it is in this, God is departed, and either men know it not, or minde it not, but beare their dolefull loſſe with a ſtupid and a ſinfull patience, or rather with a ſtupid dulneſſe.

               <p n="1">1. That <hi>comfort is your ſtrength:</hi> The more a man ſeeth and feeleth the love of God, the more the heart is eſtabliſhed. There are three <hi>great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults</hi> and trials that a man is expoſed to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tentations</hi> to ſinne: He that will walke in the way of God, ſhall not alway ſaile in a calme, the great Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than will ſhew himſelfe, hee whoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories have beene many, even among the higheſt Saints. Now if your hearts bee filled with comfort, you have a ſtrength greater than the world. For the manifeſtation of divine love is the incendiary of love, which is ſtronger than death. So long as love to Chriſt is
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:28191:299"/>kept up, the heart is ſafe, love is a ſtrong garriſon, and makes the ſoule impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. And while you keepe a freſh and cleare ſight of the love of God and Chriſt, it feeds love, and keepes it up in ſtrength. Adde to this, that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enjoyment of God, doth carry the heart aloft; it makes the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in heaven, and while a mans way is above, he is ſafe from the ſnares below. Then the heart is in danger to bee enſnared when it wanders in the creature; as the foule is in danger when ſhe is upon the earth, but when ſhe is mounted upon the wing then ſhee is ſafe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Inward accuſations:</hi> the world may accuſe, but that is not ſo ſhaking as when Satan caſts in objections; hee is a ſubtile ſophiſter and comes oft with ſnarling and cunning diſputes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be well ſetled, hee will drive you from your ground: except God cleare the ſtate of your ſoules and give evidence to your graces, you will not bee able to hold up againſt Satan; I ſpeake this to ſuch who live with low

<pb n="552" facs="tcp:28191:302"/>armes, for he is deare unto him, and the Father hath determined to powre out all his love through the Son; Chriſt is ſet before you, ſtirre up your ſelves to take hold of him; if you will come to him, you have the Fathers heart. You make your caſe to be Chriſts caſe when you come to him, and he cannot bee denyed: the Fathers mercies melt at the Sons mediation. You may pray and weepe, and lift up your voyce on high, but execpt you come in Chriſt, all will not profit. Then a man comes in Chriſt, when he thankfully accepts of the offer of Chriſt, and devolves his cares upon him, deſiring in his heart that Chriſt would undertake for him, and then beleeves that he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; any one of theſe wanting, you come not in Chriſt. 1 You muſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the offer of Chriſt, counting him worthy of all acceptation. 2 You muſt caſt your ſelves upon Chriſt, elſe hee will not undertake for you; holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance engageth him, and makes him your friend. 3 Then you muſt beleeve that you ſhall finde God a friend; for
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:28191:302"/>except you believe the promiſe, Chriſt will not move for you. But when you are thus come to him, then he will not faile you; the Son will be faſt to you, <hi>him that commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> John 6.37. this is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous word. Chriſt will not ſhut the doore upon you when you come: when you caſt your ſelves into his armes, he will not, no, he will not caſt you out, you have a ſure hold; when you fall into his armes, you fall into his heart, and being in his heart, you will be ſure, that if he have any power with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he will worke your peace<note n="q" place="margin">Multo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacior Chriſti mors in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, quam peccata no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.
